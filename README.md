# ReactNative-Animations

#### We have two types of animation systems provided by React-Native:

### 1. LayoutAnimation:

- It's easy to setup but we don't have much control over it.

### 2. Animated:

- It's a bit difficult to set up but we get more control over it and therefore can have more complicated animations with it..

## Animated System
Different Modules that helps in defining different paramters for the animations are:
1. Values Module:
  - It has Value and ValueXY objects to define the current values of the element.
2. Types Module:
  - It gives Decay,Spring and Timing object to define the course of animation.
3. Component Module:
  - Defines the actual component on which we apply the animation (Like Image, Text, View etc )
