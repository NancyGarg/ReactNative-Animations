# ReactNative-Animations

##### We have two types of animation systems provided by React-Native:
## 1. LayoutAnimation:
  - It's easy to setup but we don't have much control over it.
## 2. Animated:
  - It's a bit difficult to set up but we get more control over it and therefore can have more complicated animations with it.
